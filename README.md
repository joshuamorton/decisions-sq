Decisions, Decisions
=====

A project to hold algorithms, libraries, and supporting code for decision making and learning systems.  This is a work in progress.

Currently implemented:

    OnlineDecisionTree - An implementation of Decision Tree Learning that will
accept new evidence over time.  This was implemented to be very fast when adding
training examples and classifying data, and to be completely online (behavior
will change when new evidence is added without restarting or rebuilding anything).
