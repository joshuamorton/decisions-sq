Decisions, Decisions
=====

A project to hold algorithms, libraries, and supporting code for decision making and learning systems.  This is a work in progress.

Currently implemented:

    OnlineDecisionTree - A decision tree learning implementation that will accept new evidence over time.  This was implemented to be very fast when adding training examples and classifying data, and to be completely online (behavior  will change when new evidence is added without restarting or rebuilding anything).
