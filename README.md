Decisions Decisions
=====

Decision making framework, used to implement intelligent learning sytems.  This is a place to put learning/decision making libraries and algorithms, and as such is a work in progress.

Currently implemented:

    OnlineDecisionTree - An implementation of Decision Tree Learning that will
accept new evidence over time.  This was implemented to be very fast when adding
training examples and classifying data, and to be completely online (behavior
will change when new evidence is added without restarting or rebuilding anything).
